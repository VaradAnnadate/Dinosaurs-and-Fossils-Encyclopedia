                <p>🦕 The Triassic Period <br>
                    (~252 to 201 million years ago)
                    <br>

                    This is where the story of the dinosaurs begins. After a massive extinction cleared the slate, life
                    slowly returned. The world consisted of one giant supercontinent called Pangaea. This period saw the
                    rise of the very first dinosaurs, like Eoraptor and Herrerasaurus. They were mostly small, fast,
                    two-legged carnivores, living in a hot, dry world alongside early mammals and flying pterosaurs.</p>

                <p>🌳 The Jurassic Period <br>
                    (~201 to 145 million years ago)
                    <br>

                    Often called the "Age of Giants," this is when dinosaurs truly took over. Pangaea began to split
                    apart, creating more coastlines and a wetter climate. This led to lush forests of ferns and
                    conifers, providing endless food for enormous long-necked sauropods like Brachiosaurus and
                    Diplodocus. This was also the era of fierce predators like Allosaurus and the first birds, such as
                    Archaeopteryx.</p>

                    (~145 to 66 million years ago)
                    <br>
                    This was the final act for the dinosaurs. Continents drifted into more familiar positions, and new
                    flowering plants changed the landscape. This period featured the most famous dinosaurs, including
                    the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex and the three-horned Triceratops. The era ended suddenly with a massive
                    asteroid impact, leading to a mass extinction that paved the way for mammals to rise.</p>
